## Interview slides
- Make sure you keep them light on text and pull out the key messages from your proposal in an accessible way
- Do spend time on the “Things you’ve done since submitting"
	- For me I was lucky to be able to highlight a new very high-profile ATLAS result that I led that was just presented at LHCP.
- Get non-physicists to read your slides
	- I got several people to read mine. 
	- The most helpful 
		- Mock interview panel (with non-physicists)
		- My friend from Uni (we did Physics UG together, but he’s not been in physics since)
	- Gave a lot of input on bringing out the “big impact” statements and making it accessible to non-specialists
		- E.g. messages like
			- “Understanding the fate of the universe"
			- “Factor 3 improvement in sensitivity"
 
## Interview itself 
- Do lots of practise, again with people from different backgrounds 
- For e.g. RS URF the panel is broad, includes e.g. Geologists - you need to sell to them too (and you don’t have long anyway)
	- So practice with people not in HEP - they can immediately see whether your proposal sounds generically impressive or not.


- Practise with students and post-docs - they will help you check you know the basics (I was asked in a mock interview - does your projection include the other combination channels and if not how do they look? I knew the answer for the latest results, but not the projections for the end of Run 3).
- Practise with senior people in your field - they can test your wider knowledge a bit more and help you see better the bigger picture
- Make sure you have a list of fairly generic questions that you can answer
	- What happens if your research isn’t funded 
	- Have an idea about the future
- Think of and
- Speak to lots of people
	- Get tips!
- TODO (check my interview notes)
- TODO (collate other people’s interview tips, e.g. Dan, Jay, Conor)
