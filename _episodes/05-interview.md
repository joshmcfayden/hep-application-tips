## Interview slides
- Make sure you keep them light on text and pull out the key messages from your proposal in an accessible way
- If asked, do spend time on the “Things you’ve done since submitting"
	- Do you have a recent high-profile result that you make significant contributions to? Then mention it!
- Get non-physicists to read your slides
	- The most helpful 
		- Mock interview panel (with non-physicists)
		- Friends from University? (People who studied physics but are not HEP researchers would be a good level)
	- This can help a lot to bring out the “big impact” statements and making it accessible to non-specialists
		- E.g. messages like
			- “Vital to understanding the fate of the universe"
			- “Factor 3 improvement in sensitivity"

## Interview itself 
- Do lots of practise, again with people from different backgrounds 
- For e.g. RS URF the panel is broad, includes e.g. Geologists - you need to sell to them too (and you don’t have long anyway)
	- So practice with people not in HEP - they can immediately see whether your proposal sounds generically impressive or not.


- Practise with students and post-docs - they will help you check you know the basics
- Practise with senior people in your field - they can test your wider knowledge a bit more and help you see better the bigger picture
- Make sure you have a list of fairly generic questions that you can answer
	- What happens if your research isn’t funded?
	- Make sure you have an idea about the longer term future of your proposed field.

- Think of and try to come up with answers to generic questions:

> List more questions!

- Speak to lots of people
	- Get tips!


> ## TODO
>- check interview notes
>- collate other people’s interview tips
