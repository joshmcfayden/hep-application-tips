# Luck

## A note about being lucky
- I was very lucky
- I was asked to be ttHML analysis coordinator at a time when I wasn’t expecting it
	- This made a massive difference to my final proposal (see below) 
- I was lucky to have results come out at the perfect time
	- ttHML CONF came out right after my application 
	- Ttbar LFU came out just before my interview 
	- Small things… but you can also use them to your advantage (e.g. interview - see below)
- Lucky to get Maltoni as named collaborator
- Lucky in the longer term with good supervisors etc.
	- And good references

## Make your own luck
- Over the years I have deliberately kept my toe in with previous analyses in case they become useful again
	- For example: ttHML, Zbb
	- This gives you a lot more flexibility in topics for a proposal where you can back-up your proposal topic with experience
- Leadership roles
	- These are important to back up your claims of experience 
	- but also raise your profile in the experiment 
		- Get access to more senior people 
		- Good for references! - This is a super important point IMO
- Timing
	- I applied with 6 months left on my contract the application process takes ~10 months
	- I managed to get a short term contract to bridge the gap
	- But if I hadn’t got the fellowship I would have been out of the field 
- CV of failures...
