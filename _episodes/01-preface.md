# Luck

Some people are brilliant and write brilliant proposals, but for almost everyone luck plays a large part in being successful on these applications!

## Personal examples of being lucky
- Being lucky in the longer term with good supervisors.
- Lucky that a previous supervisor became ATLAS Physics Coordinator which added more weight to an already strong reference letter writer.
- Being asked to be analysis coordinator at timely moments
	- Can make a big difference to the strength of a proposal - adding a lot of weight to your experience.
- Lucky to have results made public at convenient times
	- Main analysis publication coming soon before/after application
	- Another high profile analysis publication came out (and got press from ATLAS and CERN) just before interview.
		- You can also use them to your advantage (e.g. interview - see later)
- Lucky to get a well known theorist as a named collaborator

## Making your own luck

Yes, very cliched! But to some extent there are things you can do to open up more opportunities.

- Most people naturally cover different topics across their PhD and first post-docs. It can useful to keep in touch with previous analyses in case they become useful again.
	- This gives you a lot more flexibility in topics for a proposal where you can back-up your proposal topic with relevant experience.
	- More opportunity to get "paper editor" and "analysis coordinator" and other roles of responsibility.


> ## Balance
> Despite saying that working on many different things can be a benefit, it's also true that going in the opposite direction and being a real master of one particular topic can also work in your favour. It's also likely not to be a good idea to have very limited experience in loads of different topics, without demonstratable leadership/expertise in any of them. It's a fine line and tricky to balance!

> ## Example
> Being able to intiate an analysis with a small analysis team can make you more likely to get one of these roles (but do it also for the physics!).

- Leadership roles
	- These are important to back up your claims of experience 
	- but also raise your profile in the experiment 
		- Get access to more senior people 
		- Good for references! - This is a super important point 
- Timing
	- Application process takes ~10 months - make sure you have time left on your current contract
	        - Can be beneficial to apply in multiple round to get practise in preparing the proposal/application - don't be afraid of applying early.
