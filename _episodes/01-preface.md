# Luck

Some people are brilliant and write brilliant proposals, but almost everyone luck plays a large part in being successful on these applications!

## Personal examples of being lucky
- I was very lucky
- Lucky in the longer term with good supervisors etc.
- Very luck that my PhD supervisor became ATLAS Physics Coordinator which added more weight to what was already a strong reference.
- I was asked to be analysis coordinator at a time when I wasn’t expecting it.
	- This made a massive difference to my final proposal (it was the main reason I switched topic to something Higgs-focussed)
- I was lucky to have results come out at the perfect time
	- Main analysis CONF note came out right after my application 
	- Another high profile analysis paper came out (and got press from ATLAS and CERN) just before my interview.
	- Small things… but you can also use them to your advantage (e.g. interview - see below)
- Lucky to get a well known theorist as a named collaborator

## Making your own luck

Yes, very cliched! But to some extent there are things you can do to open up more opportunities.

- Most people naturally cover different topics across their PhD and first post-docs. It can useful to keep in touch with previous analyses in case they become useful again.
	- This gives you a lot more flexibility in topics for a proposal where you can back-up your proposal topic with relevant experience.
	- More opportunity to get "paper editor" and "analysis coordinator" roles - see below.
	        - One new analysis that I helped initiate in the 2 years before my application I was particularly keen on partly because I knew it was a small analysis team I would be more likely to get one of these roles (it was also just a super cool analysis!).

> ## Balance

> Despite saying that working on many different things can be a benefit, it's also true that going in the opposite direction and being a real master of one particular topic can also work in your favour. It's also likely not to be a good idea to have very limited experience in loads of different topics, without demonstratable leadership/expertise in any of them. It's a fine line and tricky to balance!

- Leadership roles
	- These are important to back up your claims of experience 
	- but also raise your profile in the experiment 
		- Get access to more senior people 
		- Good for references! - This is a super important point IMO
- Timing
	- I applied with 6 months left on my contract the application process takes ~10 months
	- I managed to get a short term contract to bridge the gap
	- But if I hadn’t got the fellowship I would have been out of the field
