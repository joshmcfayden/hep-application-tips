## Give yourself plenty of time
- First to prepare the application
- But also to apply in multiple rounds!
	- My successful application came on my second attempt after making quite a big change of focus (precision electroweak measurements vs top+Higgs measurements)
- You get a good understanding of the process first time around, but you may not have a well tweaked proposal
  - For example it is hard to find time to step back think more about the physics when you're knee-deep in writing various parts of the application for the first time.
- You may consider re-focussing your proposal after the first round.

> ## Priorities...
>
> If you need to, sacrifice other commitments to spend time on these applications. In the long run they are *sooo* much more important than whether your next analysis makes ICHEP etc...
