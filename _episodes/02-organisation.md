# Orgainisation

## Give yourself plenty of time
- First to prepare the application
- But also to apply in multiple rounds!
	- My successful application came on my second attempt after making quite a big change of focus (precision V and VV+jets measurements with PDF fits â€”> tt+H/Z/W plus new tW-scattering measurement with EFT fits)
- You get a good understanding of the process first time around, but you may not have a well tweaked proposal (e.g. it is hard to find time to step back)
-  You may consider re-focussing your proposal after the first round.
- If you need to, sacrifice other commitments to spend time on these applications. In the long run they are soo much more important than whether your next analysis makes ICHEP etc...
