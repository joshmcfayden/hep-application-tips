Daunting as it may seem, if you're several application rounds in and still not having much luck it might be a good idea to see what else is out there...

## Life outside of academia may not be so bad
- The prospect of not being able to continue in your chosen career path can be very sad and even depressing.
- Having to apply for jobs in a completely new (and alien) field with e.g. different formats for job applications and interview styles while trying to do your day-to-day work can be really tough mentally an physically.
- But... in some ways it could reduce the stress of your other academia-based applications...?


> ## Example
> One of us were in the position of being out of contract before hearing back from submitted applications - this meant we had no choice but to also apply for non-academia jobs.
> 
> There can some major pros to these jobs compared to academia...
>    - Permanent from the start and had quite a lot of opportunity for internal progression
>    - The money can often be better!
> In the end there may be no competition, but on the whole the experience could make you feel a lot less penned in and stressed about being “stuck” in academia.
