Daunting as it may seem, if you're several application rounds in and still not having much luck it might be a good idea to see what else is out there...

## Life outside of academia may not be so bad
- The prospect of not being able to continue in your chosen career path can be very sad and even depressing.
- Having to apply for jobs in a completely new (and alien) field with e.g. different formats for job applications and interview styles while trying to do your day-to-day work can be really tough mentally an physically.
- But... in some ways it could reduce the stress of your other academia-based applications...?
- Being out of contract before hearing back from submitted applications meant I basically had no choice but to also apply for non-academia jobs.
  - I actually did get one non-HEP job offer, luckily I had already been offered my fellowship.
  - In some ways it was still a little bit tempting to take this job outside academia!
	- The job was permanent from the start and had quite a lot of opportunity for internal progression
	- The money was ~£15k/year better than my fellowship!
   - I love physics and in the end the was no competition, but on the whole the experience made me feel a lot less penned in and stressed about being “stuck” in academia.
