## Life outside of academia may not be so bad
- The prospect of not being able to continue in your chosen career path can be very sad and even depressing
- Having to apply for jobs in a completely new (and alien) field with e.g. different formats for job applications and interview styles while trying to do your day-to-day work can be really tough mentally an physically 
- But… in some ways it could reduce the stress of your other academia-based applications...?
- My contract was a few months from ending and I didn’t have anything concrete in the pipeline to stay in physics. I have a young family to support so I basically had no choice but to apply for non-academia jobs.
- I applied for a few jobs in the Civil Service in London.
- I even got to interview for one of them
- I didn’t get offered the job immediately but did get put on the reserve list. I got offered the job a week or two later, but after I found out that I got the RS URF!
- In some ways it was still a little bit tempting to take this job outside academia!
	- The job was permanent from the start and the Civil Service has quite a lot of opportunity for internal progression
	- The money was ~£15k/year better than the URF!
- I love physics and in the end the was no competition, but on the whole the experience made me feel a lot less penned in and stressed about being “stuck” in academia.
