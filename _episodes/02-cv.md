# CV & References

## References
- As high profile as possible 
- But need to be high on detail 
- For UK fellowships it’s typically helpful to get someone who the reviewers/panel will recognise 
	- I.e. a high-profile UK-based person

## Leadership roles
- I think you need them
	- Helps back-up your claims of experience
	- Enhances your overall CV
- I have a lot (you probably don’t need this many)
	- Previous
		- PMG Convener
		- MC Prod Coord
	- Current (for proposal)
		- ttHML analysis coord
		- Ttbar LFU analysis coord
		- HSF Generators WG Convner
		- ECFA ECR Organising Committee member 
- It’s not directly in control of getting these or not but you can help yourself
	- Be attentive in meetings - contribute
	- Accept small responsibilities that can help you up the ladder
		- From e.g. writing a section of an INT note/being editor of an INT note
		- To taking on a small technical responsibility e.g. SUSY MC Prod Manager

# Career moves
- I went from PhD->Post-doc->CERN Fellowship
- I think this kind of progression does help your CV
- I’m not sure that e.g. having a CERN Fellowship makes a huge difference...
