## General

### What are you trying to show?
- Why this topic? (Wider picture)
- Why is it innovative? (Needs to be something new/exciting)
- Why me? (Why I’m the best person in the world to do this?)

> ## The Holy Trinity...

> Hard as it may be, you basically have to be ticking all these boxes.

### Talk to lots of different people!

> This is one of the most important tips of all!
{: .discussion}


- Get input from a wide range of people
- If you’re able to, definitely look at previous (preferably successful) applications
    - Some institutes keep a “library" of successful apps.
- Try at least running the idea past people on different experiments (e.g a proposal on *ATLAS* could be discussed with someone on *g-2* or *DUNE*)
    - Also try discussing it with the relevant theorists, if appropriate.
- If possible, discuss it with senior people at the level that would be on the panel for this kind of application.


### Know what’s in vogue
- You may not like it but sometimes helps to be in touch with what the in vogue topics of the day are
	- E.g. EFTs, Machine Learning, Higgs self-coupling
	- This is not to say that you should only write proposals on these things, but that you should know what is generally found to be appealing about them:
		- Cutting edge tech, research that is clearly interdisciplinary 
	- BUT... just mentioning these things is not enough, that’s just obvious buzzword dropping - you have to back it up!
	  	- Every application will mention Machine Learning, if you are going to include this, be specific!
		- E.g if you want to include EFT fits in your proposal it would help to back it up by making a toy EFT fit (and killer plot) to show that you actually know how to do it.

- Anecdotal example:
        - Discussing an application with someone at a senior level (who had been on these sorts of panels) from a different field they said: *"if it doesn’t involve the Higgs self-coupling don’t bother"*. They were certainly 90% joking, but you get the idea...

## Specifics

### Think about how your experience fits in
- In general you are expected to be one of the best people in the world to do the research you propose.
- This means you have to have the experience to back up the physics in your proposal or at least closely aligned experience
	- A reason why analysis coordination roles can be so important.
	- Applications are also strengthened by fitting in with e.g. previous convenership positions.


### Do not be vague!

> ## No really, don't!

> We cannot emphasise this enough! From the other applications we've read from other people this is by far one of the most common complaints!
{: .discussion}

- Staying I will do X,Y,Z and it will make everything “better” is really not going to cut it.
- Include quantitive studies if possible
- You need numbers and something to back them up (preferably your own studies, or at least theory/pheno papers)
  - See example about putting together a toy EFT fit above.
