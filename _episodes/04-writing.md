# Writing

## General

### What are you trying to show?
- Why this? (Wider picture)
- Why is it innovative? (Needs to be something new)
- Why me? (Why I’m the best person in the world to do this?)
	- Why this and me?

### Talk to lots of different people
- Get input from a wide range of people
- If you’re able to look at previous applications (so institutes keep a “library" of successful apps).
- Try at least running the idea past people on different experiments (in my case g-2)
- I also ran it past theorists
- Also try to run it past senior people at the level that would be on the panel for this kind of application


### Know what’s in vogue
- You may not like it but sometimes helps to be in touch with what the in vogue topics of the day are
	- E.g. for me: EFTs, Machine Learning, Higgs self-coupling
	- This is not to say that you should write proposals on these things but that you should know what is generally found to be appealing about them
		- Cutting edge tech, research that is clearly interdisciplinary 
	- BUT… just mentioning these things is not enough, that’s just obvious buzzword dropping - you have to back it up
		- I did a toy EFT fit and showed the effect of modifications to the Higgs self coupling for differential ttH measurements.

- I discussed my application with someone at a senior level (who had been on these sorts of panels) they said (50% joking 50% serious): "if it doesn’t involve the Higgs self-coupling don’t bother"

## Specifics

### Think about how your experience fits in
- In general you are expected to be one of the best people in the world to do the research you propose.
- This means you have to have the experience to back up the physics in your proposal or at least closely aligned experience
	- I was starting to think that my previous application wasn’t strong enough and was thinking that something involving the Higgs might be an easier sell. I accepted an analysis coordinator role for the ttH Multi-leptons analysis that I otherwise would probably have turned down (I wouldn’t have had enough time).
	- The tW-scattering fitted in nicely with my MC modelling experience as it covered state-of-the-art EWK corrections


### Do not be vague!
- Include quantitive studies if possible
- Staying I will do X,Y,Z and it will make everything “better” is not really going to cut it. 
- You need numbers and something to back them up (preferably your own studies, or at least theory/pheno papers)
- One of the most time consuming things about the preparation for my proposal was putting together a toy EFT fit.
	- To be honest it was probably at best ~20% accurate but it helps massively to back-up your claims and prove that you know how to execute them.
