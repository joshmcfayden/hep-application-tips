<h3><p style="text-align: center;">Hello! Welcome to the HEP Fellowship Application Tips page!</p></h3>

The intention of this page is to provide some guidance for people putting together High Energy Physics (HEP) fellowship applications.



Although there seem to be more avenues to get advice on preparing these applications these days, it is often left to the applicant to work out by trial an error. We hope that this page is useful to get some tips on how to approach application and research proposal writing that can aid people and reduce the stress a little! With a bit of luck this page will contain useful information for people with a range previous experience, from those that haven't even put anything down on paper yet, to those who are just tweaking in the final stages.



Please find a few bits of housekeeping below. __To get started__ head straight to the *Sections* menu above or click [here](01-preface/index.html).

> ## Caveats and context
>
> __The information on this page is only a guide!__
> - This guide based on a very limited scope and sample size of experience of the author - a fairly narrow viewpoint!
> - The advice (so far) comes only from the "application" side of the process and not from the point-of-view of a reviewer or panel member.
> - This page has (so far) been written from the perspective of someone working in HEP on a large LHC experiment (ATLAS) who has mostly applied to UK fellowships.

# Housekeeping

We want to go through a few bits of housekeeping about this page before you get started...


> ## Being direct
>
> The guidance provided here might come across as a little blunt, but it is not our intention to make anyone feel bad about what they already have prepared. We are just being deliberately direct so as to, hopefully, be as helpful as possible!

## Development of this page

It is our hope that this page can be improved by inputs from other people. Please use the `Improve this page` link at the top of the page to make a suggestion via *GitHub*.


## Our background

Why are we qualified to write this page? The authors of this page are not people who routinely review proposals or are on fellowship application panels. However, we have had both (many) failures and (some) success in these applications, which allow us some perspective on what works and what doesn't.
    

### CV of Failures

Despite having some success in fellowship application we are all too aware that many people will also be struggling with rejection. We've been there too and to help normalise these experiences we think it's useful to share a *"CV of failures"* from one of the authors to show that this success is not easy to achieve.

Success came after 3 rejections from similar fellowship applications:
- 1x Royal Society University Research Fellowship
- 2x STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship

*(Each of these previous rejections was really hard to take!)*

In the 2 years leading up to this there were 3 other failed applications for senior positions. Only once did this lead to an interview and none of the applications were successful:
- 2x Lectureships at UK universities
- 1x CERN Staff (LD)

*(All also very hard to take!)*
