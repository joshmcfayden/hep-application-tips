# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the HEP Fellowship Application Tips page!

This idea of this page is to provide some guidance for people putting together High Energy Physics (HEP) fellowship applications.


> ## Caveats
>
> The information on this page is only a guide!
> It is also a guide based on a very limited scope and sample size of experience. Also, this advice (so far) comes only from the "application" side of the process and not from the point-of-view of a reviewer or panel member.
